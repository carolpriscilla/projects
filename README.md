These are the code snippets of the Rice leaf disease I worked on.
The project encompassed the creation of a deep learning model designed to categorize images depicting various types of rice leaf diseases. The dataset comprised images representing three distinct rice leaf diseases: bacterial blight, brown spot, and leaf smut. The project was organized into multiple phases, which encompassed tasks such as data exploration, data preprocessing, the development and training of deep learning models, and the assessment of model performance.
